Patches to Universal Feed Parser. Not all are strictly required.
The builtin version of feedparser.py has those already applied.

The patches are managed using Stacked Git.

------------------

Fedparser automatically uses an enclosure url as the item id/guid.
However, we want to provide our own addin to do this optionally.
