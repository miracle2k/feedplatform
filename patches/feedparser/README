Patches to Universal Feed Parser. Not all are strictly required.
The builtin version of feedparser.py has those already applied.

The patches are managed using Stacked Git.


no-enclosure-as-id
------------------

Fedparser automatically uses an enclosure url as the item id/guid. We
however want to provide our own addin to do this optionally. If this
patch is not applied, the ``guid_by_enclosure`` addin will have no
effect, and Feedparser's own enclosure-as-id functionality will have
preference over any custom addins.
