Patches to Universal Feed Parser. The builtin version of
``feedparser.py`` has them already applied.

Not all are strictly required. More information is included with each
patch file.

The patches are managed using Stacked Git. When updating the patches, use
"stg export"  and make sure to copy all the patch files over: subsequent
patches of the one you edited likely changed as well.
