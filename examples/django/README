Django integration sample
-------------------------

View/Template-wise, there isn't all that much to see, but try:

    $ ./manage.py feedplatform

for controlling feedplatform, and see ``aggregator.settings.py`` 
for how the integration was set up.

Note that we're not using the standard Django project/app-style
directory layout simply to avoid issues with our parent folder
being named "django". Instead, the "aggregator" directory is
both app and project and holds the settings file.
